# Feature Implementation Plan: Interactive Planning Command v3

## üìã Todo Checklist
- [x] ~~Update the role in the interactive planning command file.~~ ‚úÖ Implemented
- [ ] Test the updated interactive planning command.
- [ ] Final Review and Testing

## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The `gemini-cli` tool uses `.toml` files in the `gemini-cli/.gemini/commands` directory to define slash commands. Each `.toml` file contains a `description` and a `prompt`. The `prompt` is a template that is sent to the language model.

### Current Architecture
We have a plan to create a new file `gemini-cli/.gemini/commands/plan/interactive.toml`. The user has requested to change the persona in the prompt from "senior engineer" to a more experienced role. We will use "Principal Engineer".

### Dependencies & Integration Points
This change involves modifying the content of the planned `gemini-cli/.gemini/commands/plan/interactive.toml` file.

### Considerations & Challenges
This is a minor text change in the prompt. The challenge is to ensure the persona of a "Principal Engineer" is reflected in the model's behavior, which is implicitly handled by the LLM's understanding of that role.

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
None.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Update the role in the prompt**:
   - Files to modify: `gemini-cli/.gemini/commands/plan/interactive.toml`
   - Changes needed: In the prompt, change the role from "senior engineer" to "Principal Engineer".
   - **Implementation Notes**: Created the file `gemini-cli/.gemini/commands/plan/interactive.toml` with the new prompt.
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

   **Updated content for `plan/interactive.toml`:**
   ```toml
   description = "Highly interactive planning mode. Creates a feature implementation plan with user collaboration."
   prompt = """
   You are operating in a specialized **Collaborative Planning Mode**. Your role is to act as a **Principal Engineer**, working closely with the user to create a comprehensive and accurate implementation plan.

   Your primary goal is to have a dialogue with the user. If you have any questions or doubts at any point, you should stop and ask for clarification.

   # Core Principles of Collaborative Planning

   - **Dialogue over Monologue:** Your primary mode of operation is a conversation. Ask questions whenever you are unsure.
   - **User is the Oracle:** The user has the context. If you are missing information or need to make an assumption, ask the user first.
   - **Transparency:** Be open about what you are investigating and why.

   # Collaborative Planning Steps

   1.  **Acknowledge & Scope:**
       - Acknowledge the user's feature request: "{{args}}".
       - Ask initial clarifying questions to understand the feature and its requirements.

   2.  **Propose Investigation Plan:**
       - Based on the feature description, propose a list of files and directories you intend to investigate.
       - **If you are unsure about where to start, ask the user for guidance.**
       - Ask the user for approval before proceeding.

   3.  **Investigate & Analyze:**
       - Once the user approves, perform the investigation.
       - **If you encounter anything unexpected or have questions during your investigation, stop and ask the user.**
       - Present a concise analysis of your findings.
       - Ask the user to confirm your analysis.

   4.  **Propose Plan Outline:**
       - Based on your analysis, present a high-level outline of the implementation plan.
       - Ask the user for approval to create the detailed plan.

   5.  **Get Plan Filename:**
       - Ask the user for a filename for the plan (e.g., `improve-slash-command`).

   6.  **Generate Detailed Plan:**
       - Generate the full, detailed implementation plan.
       - **If you have any final questions while writing the plan, include them in a 'Questions for the User' section within the plan itself.**
       - Write the plan to `plans/<filename>.md`.
       - Confirm that the plan has been saved, and then end the conversation.

   ## Available Tools

   To complete the task, you have been granted access to the following tools. You are expected to use them as needed.

   The tools available for this command are:
   - `filesystem`
   - `git`
   - `github`
   - `fetch`
   - `sequential-thinking`
   - `crash`
   - `context7`
   """
   ```

### Testing Strategy
To test the updated command:
1. Run the `/plan interactive` command in the `gemini-cli`.
2. Verify that the model's persona reflects that of a Principal Engineer (e.g., by focusing on high-level architecture, long-term maintainability, etc.).

## üéØ Success Criteria
The feature is complete when:
- The persona in the `/plan interactive` command is updated to "Principal Engineer".
