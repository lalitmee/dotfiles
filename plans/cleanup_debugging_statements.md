# Feature Implementation Plan: Cleanup Debugging Statements

## üìã Todo Checklist
- [ ] Explain the purpose of the debugging statements (`set -x` and `set -e`)
- [ ] Remove the `set -x` debugging line from `tool.sh`
- [ ] Restore the `set -e` error-handling line in `tool.sh`
- [ ] Final Review and Testing

## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Explanation of Debugging Changes

The user has observed verbose logging and asked about the changes made. This is the expected outcome of the previous debugging phase. The changes were temporary and intended to help diagnose the problem.

*   **`set -x` (`xtrace`)**: This command was added to the script. Its purpose is to print every command and its arguments to the terminal *before* it is executed. This is what caused the "lot of logging" you observed. It provides a detailed trace of the script's execution flow, which was essential for seeing exactly where it was failing.

*   **`set -e` (`errexit`)**: This command was commented out (`# set -e`). Its purpose is to make the script exit immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero exit code). We disabled it so that even if a command failed, the script would continue running. This prevented the popup from disappearing instantly and allowed us to see the error messages produced by `set -x`.

*   **Conclusion**: The debugging was successful. We found and fixed the issue. Now, the `set -x` and the commented-out `set -e` are no longer needed and should be reverted to restore the script to its normal, clean operational state.

### Files Inspected
- `/home/lalitmee/dotfiles/tmux/.config/tmux/scripts/ai/tool.sh`

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- The previous fix that refactored the script logic should be confirmed as working.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Step 1**: Remove Debug Trace Command
    -   **Files to modify**: `/home/lalitmee/dotfiles/tmux/.config/tmux/scripts/ai/tool.sh`
    -   **Changes needed**: Delete the `set -x` line from the top of the script to disable the verbose command logging.

2.  **Step 2**: Restore Exit-on-Error Behavior
    -   **Files to modify**: `/home/lalitmee/dotfiles/tmux/.config/tmux/scripts/ai/tool.sh`
    -   **Changes needed**: Uncomment the `# set -e` line by changing it back to `set -e`. This restores the script's robust behavior of exiting immediately if an unexpected error occurs.

### Testing Strategy

After the debugging statements are removed, the script should be tested one more time to ensure the core functionality remains correct.

1.  **Trigger a keybinding** for any AI tool.
2.  Select `popup` from the layout menu. Confirm the tool opens correctly and the popup no longer contains any debug logs.
3.  Select `split` from the layout menu. Confirm the tool opens correctly in a new split.
4.  Select `window` from the layout menu. Confirm the tool opens correctly in a new window.

## üéØ Success Criteria

- The AI tool launcher works correctly for all three layout options (`popup`, `split`, `window`).
- The verbose debug logging is no longer present when the script is run.
- The script has been returned to its final, production-ready state.
