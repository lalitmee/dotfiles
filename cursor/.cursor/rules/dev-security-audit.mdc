# Security Audit

## Scope
Assess code and configuration for common security risks.

## Checks
- Dependencies: outdated/vulnerable, extraneous, pinned versions
- Secrets: keys/tokens in code, env leakage, logs
- Inputs: validation/sanitization, SSRF/SQLi/XSS surfaces
- AuthN/Z: access control, privilege checks, route/handler guards
- Crypto: hashing, encryption, nonces/IVs, insecure algorithms
- Transport: HTTPS usage, proxy settings, CORS
- Headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy (web)
- Logging: sensitive data, PII, excessive detail

## Output
- Prioritized findings (Critical/Major/Minor) with affected paths
- Proof/rationale, suggested fixes, and verification steps
- Quick wins vs long-term remediation roadmap
