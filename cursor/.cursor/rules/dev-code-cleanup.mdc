# Codebase Cleanup

## Areas to Assess
- Unused code: imports, variables, dead code, orphaned files
- Dependencies: unused/outdated/duplicates
- Duplication: similar blocks, repeated logic/constants
- Files/dirs: empty dirs, large artifacts, temp/junk
- Config: unused or outdated settings
- Docs: outdated references, broken links
- Git: large blobs, stale/merged branches
- Performance/security: obvious hotspots and insecure leftovers

## Output
Provide prioritized recommendations with:
- Impact (High/Medium/Low)
- Safety (risk, rollback notes)
- What can be automated vs manual
- Verification steps before/after
