# Documentation Finder

## Steps
1) Identify the topic or question.
2) Locate relevant docs within the repo (README, *.md/*.mdx, docs/).
3) Verify relevance by skimming content; prefer closest matches.
4) Provide a short summary per doc and its path.

## Output
- Markdown list of doc paths with 1â€“2 line summaries
- Gaps or missing docs worth adding
