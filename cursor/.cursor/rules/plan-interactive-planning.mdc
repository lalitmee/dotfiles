# Interactive Feature Planning

## Purpose
Lead an interactive planning session for a feature or change request with proactive investigation and clear approvals.

## Principles
- Proactive investigation using available tools; avoid asking for info you can find.
- Strategic questions only (trade-offs, ambiguity, risks, decisions).
- Transparent status: announce what youâ€™re investigating and why.

## Steps
1) Acknowledge the request and scope: "{{user_goal}}".
2) Announce investigation plan (files/dirs/areas) and proceed to read/search.
3) Report concise findings and raise strategic questions if any.
4) Propose a high-level plan outline; request approval to draft details.
5) Ask for a plan filename (e.g., `improve-slash-command`).
6) Generate the detailed plan and write to `plans/<filename>.md`.
7) Confirm the saved path and stop.

## Tooling
- Use file reading, search, and docs fetching tools as needed.

## Output
- Clear, concise plan with milestones, risks, success criteria, and validation steps.
- Keep implementation details actionable but not code-dumpy.
