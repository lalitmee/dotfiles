# Interactive Explanation

## Process
1) Confirm the target (file/function/flow) and context needed.
2) Explain the purpose, main logic, and data/control flow.
3) Walk through important branches and edge cases.
4) Note assumptions, dependencies, and invariants.
5) Provide small examples or traces; suggest alternatives when useful.

## Output
Clear, incremental explanation optimized for quick understanding.
