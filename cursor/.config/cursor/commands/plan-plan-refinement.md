# Plan Refinement

## Steps
1) Review the current plan and confirm goals, scope, and constraints.
2) Identify gaps, risks, ambiguous steps, and missing dependencies.
3) Propose refinements: sequencing, milestones, owners, timeboxes.
4) Define acceptance criteria and validation/demo steps.
5) Confirm trade-offs and update the plan succinctly.
