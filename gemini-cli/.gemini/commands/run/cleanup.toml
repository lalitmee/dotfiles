Perform comprehensive cleanup analysis for: {{args}}

Please conduct the following cleanup assessment:

1. **Unused Code Detection:**
   - Find unused imports and dependencies
   - Identify unreferenced variables and functions
   - Look for dead code and commented-out sections
   - Check for unused CSS classes and styles
   - Scan for orphaned files and resources

2. **Dependency Cleanup:**
   - Check package.json for unused dependencies: !{test -f package.json && npm ls --depth=0 2>/dev/null | grep -E "extraneous|UNMET" || echo "No package.json found"}
   - Identify outdated packages: !{npm outdated 2>/dev/null || echo "npm not available"}
   - Look for duplicate dependencies and version conflicts
   - Find development dependencies that could be removed

3. **Code Duplication:**
   - Identify similar code blocks that could be refactored
   - Look for repeated logic across files
   - Find duplicated constants and configuration
   - Suggest opportunities for code extraction

4. **File and Directory Cleanup:**
   - Find empty files and directories: !{find . -type d -empty -not -path "./.git/*" 2>/dev/null | head -10}
   - Identify temporary files and build artifacts
   - Look for old backup files and unused assets
   - Check for large files that could be optimized: !{find . -type f -size +1M -not -path "./.git/*" -not -path "./node_modules/*" 2>/dev/null | head -10}

5. **Configuration Cleanup:**
   - Review configuration files for unused settings
   - Check environment variables and their usage
   - Look for outdated configuration options
   - Identify conflicting or redundant settings

6. **Documentation Cleanup:**
   - Find outdated documentation references
   - Look for broken links and missing files
   - Identify incomplete or inconsistent docs
   - Check for outdated API documentation

7. **Git Repository Cleanup:**
   - Check for large files in git history: !{git rev-list --objects --all | git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | sed -n 's/^blob //p' | sort --numeric-sort --key=2 | tail -10}
   - Look for merged branches that can be deleted: !{git branch --merged | grep -v "main\|master\|develop" | head -10}
   - Identify stale branches: !{git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)' refs/heads | sort -k2 | head -10}

8. **Performance Optimization Opportunities:**
   - Identify large bundle sizes and optimization opportunities
   - Look for inefficient algorithms or data structures
   - Find opportunities for lazy loading
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders or computations

9. **Security Cleanup:**
   - Find exposed secrets or sensitive data
   - Check for insecure temporary files
   - Look for debugging code left in production
   - Identify overly permissive file permissions

10. **Cleanup Recommendations:**
    For each category, provide:
    - **Priority Level:** High/Medium/Low impact
    - **Safety Assessment:** Risk level of performing cleanup
    - **Automated vs Manual:** What can be safely automated
    - **Verification Steps:** How to confirm cleanup was successful
    - **Backup Recommendations:** What to backup before cleanup

11. **Cleanup Script Generation:**
    - Provide safe cleanup commands that can be executed
    - Include verification steps before and after cleanup
    - Suggest staging the cleanup in phases
    - Include rollback procedures for safety

Please provide a comprehensive cleanup plan with prioritized recommendations and safe execution steps.
