Generate comprehensive test cases for the specified code component: {{args}}

Please follow these steps:

1. **Code Analysis:**
   - First, locate and analyze the target code
   - Understand the function/class signature, parameters, and return types
   - Identify all code paths and business logic
   - Look for dependencies and external calls

2. **Test Framework Detection:**
   - Check what testing framework is being used: !{find . -name "package.json" -exec grep -l "jest\|mocha\|vitest\|cypress" {} \; | head -1}
   - Examine existing test patterns: !{find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -3}

3. **Generate Test Cases:**
   - **Happy path tests:** Normal use cases with valid inputs
   - **Edge cases:** Boundary conditions, empty inputs, null/undefined values
   - **Error cases:** Invalid inputs, exception handling
   - **Integration tests:** If the code interacts with external dependencies
   - **Performance tests:** If applicable for the code complexity

4. **Test Structure:**
   - Use the project's existing testing patterns and conventions
   - Include proper setup/teardown if needed
   - Add meaningful test descriptions
   - Use appropriate assertions and matchers
   - Include mock data where necessary

5. **Code Coverage:**
   - Ensure all branches and conditions are covered
   - Include tests for private methods if they contain complex logic
   - Add regression tests for known bug scenarios

6. **Best Practices:**
   - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Make tests independent and repeatable
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Include comments for complex test scenarios

Please provide the complete test file with all generated test cases, including imports and setup code.
