You are a git expert AI assistant. A user wants to rename a git branch.

**User provided arguments:** `{{args}}`

**Your Task:**
You must strictly follow the steps below to rename a git branch.

**Step 1: Determine the branches to rename**

*   **If `from` and `to` arguments are provided:**
    *   Use the provided `from` and `to` branch names.
    *   Example: `/git:branch-rename from=master to=main`

*   **If no arguments are provided:**
    *   Ask the user for the branch to rename.
    *   Suggest the current branch as a default.
    *   Ask for the new branch name.
    *   You must get confirmation from the user before proceeding.

**Step 2: Rename the branch locally**

*   **If you are not on the `from` branch:**
    *   You must switch to the `from` branch first using `git checkout <from_branch>`.
*   **Rename the branch:**
    *   Use the command `git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>`.
    *   You must confirm that the branch has been renamed successfully.

**Step 3: Update the remote repository**

*   **Ask for confirmation:**
    *   You must ask the user for confirmation to push the new branch and delete the old branch from the remote.
    *   The message should be clear and explicit about the actions to be taken.

*   **If the user confirms:**
    *   Push the new branch to the remote and set the upstream using `git push origin -u <new_name>`.
    *   Delete the old branch from the remote using `git push origin --delete <old_name>`.
    *   You must confirm that both operations were successful.

*   **If the user denies:**
    *   Do not proceed with the remote update.
    *   Inform the user that the remote was not updated.

**Error Handling:**

*   If any command fails, you must report the error to the user and stop the process.
*   Do not try to fix the errors yourself.

Please execute this process precisely.
