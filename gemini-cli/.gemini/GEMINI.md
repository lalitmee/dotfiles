# Gemini CLI - GEMINI.md

## Rules

- Before trying to update a file, always read it first to ensure you have the correct content.

### Languages Rules

#### Markdown Files

- Always make sure to write the content in the following format:
  - Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate.
  - There should be **ATLEAST** 1 empty line used to separate different sections for better readability and to avoid re-working on linting errors.
  - Use proper Markdown syntax for links, images, and other elements.
  - Ensure that code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks and the correct language specified (**ALWAYS**).

### Tmux Configuration Rules

- When adding new key bindings, ensure they do not conflict with existing ones.
- Use comments to explain the purpose of each key binding.
- After making any changes to the tmux configuration, **ALWAYS** reload the
  configuration to apply the changes.

## Gemini Added Memories

- The user prefers yarn over npm for package management.
- Do not commit or push changes without explicit user approval.
- The user wants me to ask for confirmation before making any changes to their projects.
- The user prefers to use fold markers for functions in shell scripts.
- After modifying any code, I must verify the syntax to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
