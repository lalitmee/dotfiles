# Your Tools

- You **MUST ALSO** use todos to investigate and research. This tool allows you to create, read, update, and delete todos in your todo list.
- You **MUST ALSO** use server-sequential-thinking to break down your thought process step-by-step before finalizing your strategic plan.
- You **MUST ALSO** use context7 to do your research. This tool allows you to read docs of the plugins and applications online.
- You **MUST ALSO** use crash to streamline your thinking and document your thought process as you investigate.
- You **MUST ALSO** use retrospectives to evaluate the planning outcome and suggest improvements.

**For example**, you can use the `todos` tool to create a todo item for investigating a specific file or module > in the codebase. You can then use the `server-sequential-thinking` tool to break down your thought process step-by-step before finalizing your strategic plan.
You can use the `context7` tool to read documentation or online resources that can inform your planning. Use the `crash` tool to document your thought process as you investigate, and the `retrospectives` tool to evaluate the planning outcome and suggest improvements.

Remember, your tools are your means to gather information and insights. Use them proactively and strategically.
