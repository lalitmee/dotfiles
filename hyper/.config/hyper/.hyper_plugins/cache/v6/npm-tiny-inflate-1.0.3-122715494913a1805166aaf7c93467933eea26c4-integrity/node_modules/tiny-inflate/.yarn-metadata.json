    "readme": "# tiny-inflate\n\nThis is a port of Joergen Ibsen's [tiny inflate](https://bitbucket.org/jibsen/tinf) to JavaScript.\nMinified it is about 3KB, or 1.3KB gzipped. While being very small, it is also reasonably fast\n(about 30% - 50% slower than [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) on average), and should be \ngood enough for many applications. If you need the absolute best performance, however, you'll\nneed to use a larger library such as pako that contains additional optimizations.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install tiny-inflate\n\n## Example\n\nTo use tiny-inflate, you need two things: a buffer of data compressed with deflate,\nand the decompressed size (often stored in a file header) to allocate your output buffer.\nInput and output buffers can be either node `Buffer`s, or `Uint8Array`s.\n\n```javascript\nvar inflate = require('tiny-inflate');\n\nvar compressedBuffer = new Bufer([ ... ]);\nvar decompressedSize = ...;\nvar outputBuffer = new Buffer(decompressedSize);\n\ninflate(compressedBuffer, outputBuffer);\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
