/**
 * Cloudflare Workers entry, for Workers built with Wrangler.
 *
 * Wrangler's default `CompiledWasm` rule turns the `.wasm` import below into a
 * `WebAssembly.Module`; Workers cannot compile WebAssembly from bytes at runtime. Other bundlers
 * do not support the import: use `@earendil-works/pi-codemode/portable` with your own module there.
 *
 * Two ways to run codemode on Cloudflare:
 * - `RemoteCodemodeSandbox` with a {@link CodemodeSandboxDurableObject} deployed as its own
 *   Worker: scripts run in a separate isolate and never block the caller. Use this from a Durable
 *   Object that serves a session.
 * - {@link createInlineCodemodeSandbox}: scripts run on the caller's thread. Simplest; a script
 *   that computes blocks the caller until it awaits a tool or uses up its interrupt budget.

 * The remote end of `RemoteCodemodeSandbox`: a Durable Object whose one RPC method runs a script's
 * VM and calls back into the client for every tool call.
 *
 * Deploy it as its own Worker and bind it from the Worker that runs your agent with `script_name`.
 * A separate Worker is what keeps scripts off the agent's thread: a class in the same Worker can
 * share an isolate, and therefore a thread, with the objects that call it.
 *
 * The object keeps no state between executions and never touches storage. Executions that reach
 * the same instance share its thread: they interleave while they wait on tools, and a script that
 * computes delays the others. Name instances per session (`getByName(sessionId)`) to keep one
 * session's scripts together, or per execution for full independence.
 *
 * Limits apply to every request, whatever the client asks for. Override the fields in a subclass:
 *
 *     export class CodemodeSandbox extends CodemodeSandboxDurableObject {
 *       protected maxInterruptBudget = 200_000;
 *     }
